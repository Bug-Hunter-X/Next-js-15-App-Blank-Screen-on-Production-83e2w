# Next.js 15 App Blank Screen on Production

This repository demonstrates a bug in Next.js 15 where an application fails to render on the initial page load in a production environment.  The application works correctly in development mode.

## Bug Description

The application displays a blank white screen upon accessing the production URL.  No error messages are visible in the browser console.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone the repository.
2. Run `npm install`.
3. Run `npm run build`.
4. Run `npm run start`.
5. Access the application in a browser.  Observe the blank screen.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that all necessary dependencies are correctly included and that the Next.js configuration is properly set up for production deployments.

This could be due to several possible causes such as issues with the build process, missing dependencies, or incorrect server-side rendering configuration.
